        <p>Most pickleball games are lost not won. Watch some 3.5 level games and compare how often points are won with a great shot versus how often points are lost by an unforced error.</p>

        <p>One of the key takeaways from this series of clinics is for you to play in a way that will significantly reduce your unforced errors while at the same time increasing your opponents unforced errors.</p>

        <p>To do this we need to consistently hit shots within our capabilities and our opponents will take care of winning for us.</p>

        <p>If you win 55% (or more) of points, when you serve and when you receive, you will win every game you play!</p>

        <p>On the other hand, if you play a shot that you can make 80% of the time you only have a 51% likelihood of making it 3 times in a row and that drops to 41% for 4 in a row. If you can make the shot 90% of the time your 3/4 shot success rate jumps to 73% / 62%.</p>

        <p>So, a key strategy for success is to have a few shots that you play consistently well. For example, a simple forehand “tip pointing down” shot for dinks, third shot drops, third shot drives and no man’s land defense.</p>
